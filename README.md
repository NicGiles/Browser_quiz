Action Plan
In order to test my understanding of full stack web applications, I will create a thrilling browser based quiz game!

User Stories:

As a user,
In order to have the maximum possible fun on the internet,
I would like to answer multiple choice questions.

Plan: Have a range of multiple choice questions available to be answered. (Questions Database)

As a user,
In order to ensure that the fun can continue,
I would like to receive a series of randomised questions

Plan: Have a system of randomising questions (held in a db) and delivering them to user.
(Ruby app for selecting questions from DB and sending to User)

As a user,
In order to validate my genius,
I would like to receive feedback on each of my answers, in the form of 'correct' or 'incorrect'

Plan: Respond to user's answer with correct or incorrect

Evidence Plan
I'll create a working implementation of the system described above (empirical)

I'll be able to diagram the flow of information through my application, from user interactions through to the database (empirical)

I'll share my diagram with a coach in order to receive feedback (credible)
